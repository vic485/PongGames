# Pong Games
An aspiring game developer's first step™

This repo contains various implementations of the classic game Pong in different languages and engines including:
- .Net Core (C#)
- *more coming soon™*

For those looking to come into the game development scene, I recommend looking at one in your language/engine of choice; analyzing, deconstructing, re-writing, and modifying it to get started. Pong is great as a starting project as it is a relatively simple game with lots of potential for changes and improvements.
